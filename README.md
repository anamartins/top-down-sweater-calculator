A Calculator for knitting a top-down sweater easily.

I like kniting and I have learned how to make a sweater using the top down techinique some years ago. And the hardest part is all the math we need to do to build a sweater in the right size. 
So, I've made a simple calculator to help me with that. You can see it working here: <a href="https://anamartins.github.io/top-down-sweater/">anamartins.github.io/top-down-sweater</a>
